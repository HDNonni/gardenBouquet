            <p>Let me tell you a
                little about me and why I think gardening not only helps with developing ideas
                but gives you a sense of peace and relaxation to take you through the day.
            </p>
            <p> So after growing up on a farm and then doing the typical get married have children thing, I looked into
                changing careers and starting something new, coding! It is so far from what my current career is , an
                occupational therapy
                assistant, and also something I never would have thought I could do (although I get
                lots of help!). But here I am developing this site for others who hopefully can find some peace in
                their
                current or aspiring careers, through gardening.
            </p>

                Many would say , I haven't the time , there is no room in my yard, I live in the city or
                I don't know anything about gardening.

                Yes these are all valid, however I will argue that you can make time if you really want to. I have
                taken
                huge strides to change my daily routine in order
                to fit in time to learn coding and still work , take care of my gardens and find time for my family.

                <p>So what about having a small yard? Check out this site for some great ideas for container gardens
                    for
                    flowers that can still be
                    cut for an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/flowering-container-garden-plants-for-sun-847943">indoor
                        bouquet</a>!

                    or what about a <a href="https://www.grownyc.org/gardens/our-community-gardens">Community Garden

            <P>
                I am here to give you some places to find basic information to get you started. Additionally,
                some tools to help design simple gardens that you can pick a bouquet from and enjoy the season through.
                So
                grab some boots, gloves if you want and some basic garden tools and lets go play in the dirt!
            </P>
